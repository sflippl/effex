#' Effex functions: Write data
#'
#' The `fx_write`-family will cover the transformation of semantic data to
#' human-readable documents. The idea behind this is the fact that semantic data
#' is more likely to be changed manually. From the perspective of version
#' control, this means that changes can most easily be tracked if one either
#' codes these decision or makes the files human-accessible. These formats are
#' also easier to work with for non-programmers so that, after a short
#' introduction, they can change this information, as well. Reviewing changes
#' via version control is transparent in this mode. `fx_change` will be
#' concerned with making change of semantical data available to non-programmers
#' in the future.
