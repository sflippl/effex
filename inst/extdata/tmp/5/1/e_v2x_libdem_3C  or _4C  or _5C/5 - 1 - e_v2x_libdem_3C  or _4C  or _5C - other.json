These transformations offer three different ordinal versions with three (_3C), four (_4C), and five (_5C) levels respectively. For the _3C-version, one can interpret 0.0 as \"Autocratic\", 0.5 as \"Electoral Authoritarian\", and 1.0 as \"Minimally Democratic\".  For the _4C-version, one can interpret 0.0 as Autocratic\", 0.33 as \"Electoral Authoritarian\", 0.67 as \"Minimally Democratic\" and 1.0 as \"Democratic\". For the _5C-version, one can interpret 0.0 as \"Closed Autocratic\", 0.25 as \"Autocratic\", 0.5 as\"Ambivalent\", 0.75 as \"Minimally Democratic\", and 1.0 as \"Democratic\".",
