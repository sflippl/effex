    "question": "Did the country experience an internal armed conflict?  Clarification: Coded 1 if the country suffered in an internal armed conflict in a given year, 0 otherwise. The original source codebook (Brecke 2001) states that no war is coded as 0 and war is coded as 1. However, the data contains only 1’s along with missing data (no 0’s). Following the authors’ instructions (personal communication), we re-code missing observations as non-conflict (0) for countries where at least one year in the original times series (which runs from 1500 until present) was coded as 1. Source(s): Clio Infra (clio-infra.eu), drawing on Brecke (2001). Data release: 5-8. Citation: V-Dem Codebook (see suggested citation at the top of this document); Clio Infra (clioinfra.eu).",
