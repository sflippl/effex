That is, it aims to change the polity in fundamental ways, e.g., from democratic to autocratic(or vice-versa), from capitalist to communist (or vice-versa), from secular to fundamentalist(or vice-versa). This movement may be linked to a political party that competes in elections but it must also have a \"movement\" character, which is to say a mass base and an existence separate from normal electoral competition. If there are several movements, please answer in a general way about the relationship of those movements to the regime.",
