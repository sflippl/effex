    "clarification": "In order to count as a \"census\", the following four criteria needs to be satisfied: 1. UNIVERSALITY: the census attempted to cover the entire population and not just a sample. 2. INDIVIDUAL ENUMERATION: the census enumerates each individual separately and records his or her characteristics separately. If the census only produces aggregate or summarised information, it is only a population count and should not count as a census. For example, A population count of a household with 4 people would produce the following results: Age—Adults: 2; Children: 2 Sex—Males: 2; Females: 2 Instead, an individual enumeration would look like this: Head of household-male-adult Spouse-female-adult Son-male-child  Daughter-female-child The key difference is that only in the individual enumeration the data on various characteristics can be cross-tabulated. 3. DEFINED TERRITORY: The territory covered, along with any changes in its area is clearly stated. 4. SIMULTANEITY AND SPECIFIED TIME: Each person is enumerated as nearly as possible to the same well-defined point in time, and the collected data should refer to a well-defined reference period. Code \"1\" if a national census was completed in this year – but not if it was aborted or was not national in scope.",
