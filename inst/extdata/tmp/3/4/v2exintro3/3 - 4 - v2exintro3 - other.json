Some questions refer to \"members of the executive,\" i.e., the head of state, the head of government, and cabinet ministers. If you feel that the answer to a question varies across these offices, your answer should reflect the average (arithmetic mean) across these offices. Other questions refer to lower-level members of the executive branch. This will be clarified as we proceed.",
