These two variables correlate at .94. This compiled time series is interpolated increasing the number of observations from 5,181 to 11,927. Missing data for the base variable is then imputed from UNESCO’s total primary enrollment percentage, which includes those enrolled who are not of primary-school age. The linear imputation increases the number of obervations from 11,927 to 12,840.",
