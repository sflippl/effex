(A) will be referred to as \"heterosexual\" and (B) as\"LGBT.\" Note that in comparing the political power of these two groups we are comparing their power per person. So, when we say that LGBT have less, equal, or more power than heterosexuals we mean relative to their share of the population (as near as this can be estimated).",
