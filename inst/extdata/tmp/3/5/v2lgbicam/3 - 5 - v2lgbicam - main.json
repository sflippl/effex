    "notes": "For the country-year aggregation of the dataset, we have taken the minimum value of v2lgbicam. Constituent assemblies that perform other functions except for drafting and adopting a new constitution (e.g. legislating, electing president, adopting budget, etc) are coded as 1 (1 chamber). In cases when a parliament consists of three or more chambers, one of the chamber names is coded in the variable ”Lower chamber legislature name” (v2lgnamelo), while the others are listed in the variable \"Upper chamber name\" (v2lgnameup). South Africa had a three-chamber parliament during the period of 1984-1994. Subsequently, variable v2lgbicam is coded 2, v2lgnamelo is coded ”House of Assembly”, and v2lgnameup enlists ”House of Representatives, House of Delegates”.",
