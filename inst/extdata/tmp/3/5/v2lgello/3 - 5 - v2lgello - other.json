Exceptions to the norm of direct election include members who are appointed, e.g., by an executive, the military, or a theocratic body, and members who are indirectly elected by local/ regional parliaments, country/city councilors or similar. Thus, if 10% of a lower chamber is appointed in some fashion the correct answer to this question would be 90 %.  We are not concerned with non-voting members or with members of the legislature who do not possess the powers of most legislators.",
