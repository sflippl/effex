    "aggregation": "The index is formed by taking the reversed point estimates (so that higher scores = more clientelism) from a Bayesian factor analysis model of the indicators for vote-buying(v2elvotbuy), particularistic vs. public goods (v2dlencmps) and whether party linkages are programmatic or clientelistic (v2psprlnks).  Since v2elvotbuy is only measured in the years in which elections take place, we impute using the most recent known value. For years before an election ever took place (meaning there is no most recent known value) we impute up to 10 previous years using the value of v2elvotbuy in the first election conducted.",
    "clarification": "Clientelistic relationships include the targeted, contingent distribution of resources(goods, services, jobs, money, etc) in exchange for political support.",
