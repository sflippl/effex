    "aggregation": "This index receives a maximum score of two resulting from the addition of the two terms easiness of initiation and easiness of approval of popular initiatives, where each term obtains a maximum value of one. The ease of initiation is measured by- The existence of a direct democracy process v2ddlexci, - The number of signatures needed v2ddsigpci, - Time-limits to circulate the signatures v2ddsigdci. Easiness of approval is measured by the surface of the polygon determined by- Participation quorum v2ddpartci, - Approval quorum v2ddapprci, and- Supermajority v2ddspmci. For an elaboration of the interaction among quorums, see David Altman (2016). The resulting score is then multiplied with d district majority v2ddadmci. Consequences are measured by- The legal status of the decision made by citizens binding or merely consultative v2ddlexci, and- The frequency and degree of success with which direct popular votes have been held in the past v2ddthreci. The baseline for those countries that have the legal apparatus to hold a particular MDD but have never experienced one is 0.1. The index is aggregated using this formula: v2xdd_i_ci = [(IF v2ddlexci > 0, 1, 0) × (1 − v2ddsigpci)) × (IF v2ddsigdci = 0, 1, 0.5 + v2ddsigdci/365/2) + (v2ddsigdci) ∩ (v2ddpartci) ∩ (v2ddspmci)] × (0.5 + 1 − v2ddadmci/2)] × (IF v2ddlexci = 1, 0.75, 1 × IF years since last successful event < 6, then v2ddthreci = 1, afterwards decreases by 0.06 then v2ddthreci = 1, afterwards decreases by 0.06 units per year until 0.1; if the event was not successful during the first years v2ddthrerci=0.9, afterwards decreases by 0.1 units per year until 0.1)",
