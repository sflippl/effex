tectr
=====

R provides powerful opportunities to outsource everyday thought processes in data analysis. However, adapting these mechanisms for application-specific thought processes is expensive and difficult. Whenever a statistician builds a plot he needs to specify the variable name, scale transformations etc. `tectr` supports automation of these parameters. In particular, it supports automated visualization of complex datasets.

You can install tectr from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sflippl/tectr")
```

For now, an introduction to `tectr` can be found in my [https://github.com/sflippl/bachelor-thesis/blob/master/\_book/bachelor-thesis.pdf](Bachelor's%20Thesis).
